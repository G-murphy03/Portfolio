# Portfolio
Second week of the Sydney University coding bootcamp, this challenge consisted of building a portfolio page from scratch to display future work. The motive behind building a portfolio of work is it can showcase skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. 

Within this challenge, we were required to use specific skills learnt in the past week which included flexboxes, media queries, and CSS variables.

## Acceptance Criteria
- GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
-  WHEN I load their portfolio
- THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
- WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
- THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
- WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
-  THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
- WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
- THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
- WHEN I click on the images of the applications
- THEN I am taken to that deployed application
- WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
- THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
